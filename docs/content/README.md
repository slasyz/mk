# mk

**mk** is a more user-friendly `make` alternative.


## Description

You can create `mk.yml` file just like you create `Makefile`, and define all targets using modern trendy YAML syntax. After that, you can run `mk` to execute these targets.

It's just proof of concept yet, so `mk.yml` schema in unstable, and everything is going to be rewritten multiple times. If you have enough courage to use it, I'd be glad to hear any feedback.

It has nothing to do with Plan 9 `mk`, I just took the same name because it seems nice.
